This is a blog post that conducts an analysis of the [CasCast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04290) model.

## Introduction

The CasCast paper represents an advancement in the field of meteorological forecasting, particularly in the accurate prediction of precipitation using high-resolution radar data. The paper specifically addresses the challenges faced in nowcasting, which is the prediction of weather conditions for a short period, usually up to two hours ahead. Accurate Weather Forecast in the immediate future are of critical importance for the fields of disaster management and in various social sectors. This paper aims to provide a robust solution to improve prediction accuracy, especially for extreme weather events.

## Motivation

Around the world extreme weather events result in significant damages every year. One of the most destructive consequences that can be caused by these events is flooding. Flooding is due to high amounts of precipitation that occur.
Precipitation events involve multiple scales of atmospheric systems, making accurate predictions challenging.
Furthermore most current methods struggle with Short-term forecasting (NowCasting), and these predictions are essential for emergency management and disaster mitigation.


{% raw %}

```liquid
{% tabs group-name %}

{% tab group-name tab-name-1 %}

Content 1

{% endtab %}

{% tab group-name tab-name-2 %}

Content 2

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}
```

{% endraw %}

With this you can generate visualizations like:

{% tabs log %}

{% tab log php %}

```php
var_dump('hello');
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab log js %}

```javascript
console.log("hello");
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab log ruby %}

```javascript
pputs 'hello'
```

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Another example

{% tabs data-struct %}

{% tab data-struct yaml %}

```yaml
hello:
  - "whatsup"
  - "hi"
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab data-struct json %}

```json
{
  "hello": ["whatsup", "hi"]
}
```

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Tabs for something else
