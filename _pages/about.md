My name is Selim Elbindary, and I am a computer scientist specializing in Autonomous Systems. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained experience in various areas of computer science, including data science, machine learning, and software engineering.

I began my career as a Data Analytics Trainee with HYVE Technology Consulting in Cairo, Egypt, where I developed skills in handling large datasets and visualizing insights using Apache Spark and PowerBI. I then progressed to a Junior Data Scientist role at HYVE, where I worked with Large Language Models, including GPT-4, to create responsive chatbots and automate workflows.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart. My research focuses on safe human-robot collaboration, utilizing synthetic datasets to train models for improved safety in warehouse environments. This position allows me to combine my interest in machine learning with practical applications in robotics.

My academic research at the German University in Cairo (GUC) involved designing new methods for wildfire detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I have also contributed to the field with my paper on satellite imagery road segmentation, presented at the 2021 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems.

I have technical skills in Python, Java, and SQL, and I am familiar with tools like Omniverse, ISAAC SIM, and Docker. Additionally, I am multilingual, fluent in English, Arabic and French, with basic knowledge of German and Spanish.

I am committed to exploring the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence, aiming to make meaningful contributions through my research and practical applications in the industry. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me.
